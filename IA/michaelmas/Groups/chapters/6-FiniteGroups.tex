\chapter{Finite Groups}
We have already seen some nice theorems about finite groups:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Lagrange's Theorem
  \item Orbit-Stabiliser Theorem
  \item Cayley's Theorem
  \item Cauchy's Theorem
\end{itemize}
We will now spend some time thinking about small examples of finite groups.
