\section{Basics}
What is the derivative of a function at a point?
\begin{definition}[Differentiable]
  Let $f: X \subseteq \C \to \C$ and $a \in X$.
  $f$ is differentiable at $a$ if the limit:
  \[
    \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}
  \]
  exists.

  The value of this limit is then called the \textit{derivative} of $f$ at $a$ and is denoted $f'(a)$ or $\deriv{f}{x}(a)$.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}[Note]
  Here both $x \in X$ and $a + h \in X$, we cannot approach it from outside of the domain.
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
  We can't make sense of the derivative at an isolated point of the domain.
  We \textit{could} define it to have a particular value but it would not lead to any interesting behaviour.
\end{remark}
For accumulation points, we can distinguish how we approach $a$:
\begin{itemize}
  \item For interior points, we can approach in any direction.
    If the limits from different direction disagree, then the limit does not exist.
  \item For non-interior points, the domain restricts how we approach $a$.
\end{itemize}
\begin{example}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Consider $f(z) = z$.
      This is differentiable at all points as:
      \[
        f'(z) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(z + h) - f(h)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} 1 =1
      \]
    \item Consider $f(z) = \overline{z}$.
      This is not differentiable at any point.
      Try $h = \lambda \in \R$.
      \[
        \lim_{\lambda \to 0} \frac{f(z + \lambda) - f(z)}{\lambda} = \lim_{\lambda \to 0} \frac{\lambda}{\lambda} = 1
      \]
      But if we try $h = i\lambda$:
      \[
        \lim_{\lambda \to 0} \frac{f(z + \lambda) - f(z)}{i\lambda} = \lim_{\lambda \to 0} \frac{-i\lambda}{\lambda} = -1
      \]
      So the limit from different directions disagrees and so does not exist.
    \item Consider $f(x) = \sin x$. This is differentiable at all points on $\R$.
      \begin{align*}
        f'(x) &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sin(x + h) - \sin(x)}{h} \\
              &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sin h\cos x}{h} + \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sin x (\cos h - 1)}{h} \\
              &= \cos x \cdot \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sin h}{h} + \sin x \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\cos h - 1}{h}
      \end{align*}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{example}
