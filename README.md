# Cambridge Mathematics Lecture Notes
These are my personal notes taken whilst studying the undergraduate [Cambridge Maths Tripos](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/undergrad/undergrad).

The notes are **not in any way official** and **do not represent the content of lectures or supervision material**.

These notes are for personal study purposes so be mindful for any mistakes/omissions if using these notes for self-study or revision.
Furthermore, **any and all errors are my own**.

I created these notes using neovim with VimTeX and LuaSnip. My config can be found [here](https://github.com/ras257/nvf-tex-config).

## Errors & Suggestions
If you spot any errors or have suggestions, Iâ€™d greatly appreciate it if you sent them to [ras257@srcf.net](mailto:ras257@srcf.net).
